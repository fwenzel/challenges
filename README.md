# Programming challenges

This is a loose collection of solutions to various programming challenges that piqued my interest. Among them:

* Programming Praxis ([programmingpraxis.com](http://programmingpraxis.com))

In addition, I have separate repositories for other challenges such as:

* [Synacor OSCON Challenge](https://github.com/fwenzel/synacor-challenge)


## Contributing

This is Open Source. Take a look around, learn, feel free to challenge me on a solution in an Issue or email if you like.

If you're a recruiter or the like, take a look to get a feel of what I do, but don't assume that one suboptimal solution is representative of all that I do ;) I solve these things for entertainment, after all.
